<h1 align="center">Unleashing the Power of CNNs: Classifying Cats and Dogs</h1>

## Description
<div style="text-align: justify">

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset comprising 4,000 images of cats and 4,000 images of dogs, and tested on a separate set of 1,000 images each for cats and dogs to evaluate its performance.

After training and testing, the model can classify new images as either a cat or a dog by providing input images from the `single_prediction` folder. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for image classification tasks.

The CNN was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, leveraging their high-level APIs for ease of building and training neural networks. Key stages include data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dataset
- **Training Data**: 4,000 cat images and 4,000 dog images
- **Test Data**: 1,000 cat images and 1,000 dog images
- **Prediction**: Images to classify stored in the `single_prediction` folder

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max Pooling layers
- Batch Normalization layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Fully connected layers
- Sigmoid activation for binary classification

## ðŸš€ Future improvements
- Enhance model performance with data augmentation and transfer learning.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy and generalization.
- Add additional classes for more complex image classification tasks.
- Use pretained models to compare with my CNN built CNN model.
- Use large dataset on the same model to see how it works with more data and variations
